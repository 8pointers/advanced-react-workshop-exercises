## Exercise (ex-7)

Design and implement a solution for displaying visual feedback for long-running asynchronous operations (including, but not limited to HTTP requests; it should work with any promise-based opeartion). The async operation should have a means to 'signal' that the operation has started and completed (success or failure). While the operation is ongoing the custom `Spinner` component should provide visual feedback.
