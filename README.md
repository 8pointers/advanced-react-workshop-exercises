testing - Clock component

# Proposal

A two-day practical workshop on advanced React and Redux. Delivery would be split into following four modules:

- React hooks
- Redux
- Testing
- Performance

## React hooks

Focus would be on more advanced React hooks and their usage, as well as implementing custom hooks. Topics would include:

- facilitate shared access with useContext
- useCallback & useRef
- memoization (useMemo) and pure components
- encapsulating reusable behaviour using custom hooks
- dealing with cross-cutting concerns

## Redux

Focus would be on real-world Redux applications and the following topics would be covered:

- building efficient reducer functions (incl. optics/lenses)
- working with asynchronous code
- building custom Redux middlewares
- working with promises and asynchronous code
- Redux & RxJS

## Testing

The main focus would be on unit and integration level tests. The following topics would be covered:

- Jest framework, React Testing Library, DOM Testing Library, Jest Fetch Mock
- testing React components
- testing Redux reducers and action creators
- testing asynchronous code
- dependency injection/isolation
- using test doubles (incl. stubbing http calls)

## Performance

- React internals/reconcilliation overview
- the importance of immutability and immutable data structures
- caching/useRef/useCallback & memoization
- writing efficient and correct effectful code
- connecting components to Redux store in optimal way (mapStateToProps & mapDispatchToProps)
- using optics/lenses
- windowing/virtualization
- performance tuning/chrome developer tools
