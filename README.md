# Advanced React Workshop Exercises

## Prerequisites

- git client
- Docker (Docker Desktop on MacOS/Windows)
- Visual Studio Code with [Remote - Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension installed

## Setup

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/8pointers/advanced-react-workshop-exercises.git
```

Open the `advanced-react-workshop-exercises` folder in Visual Studio Code.

If Visual Studio Code prompts you to reopen the folder in container, accept. Otherwise open Visual Studio Code Command Palette (CMD+SHIFT+P/CTRL+SHIFT+P) and select `Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container`.

Once the container is built and ready, open Visual Studio Code Command Palette and select `View: Toggle Terminal` (CTRL+`) to open a built-in terminal and then run:

```sh
npm start
```
